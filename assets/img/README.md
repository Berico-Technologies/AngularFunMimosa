# `img` Directory.  Put images here...duh!

On a separate note, the Glyphicons Icons are not used in preference of __Font Awesome__.  If you want to use them instead, you will need to uncomment the `@import "sprites.less";` (line 30) of `assets/stylesheets/vendor/bootstrap.less`.  Also, please remove the css import of _Font Awesome_ from your `index.html` or `index.jade` file.
