# JavaScript libraries from outside sources

Put any JavaScript of CoffeeScript source files you have "borrowed" from another source.  Please remember, you may need to "shim" the file if it is not RequireJS compliant.  Simply follow the configuration to "shim" the file in `assets/javascripts/main.coffee`.
